hinge significantly on how text data is prepared and processed before training. At the heart of this preparation is
the process of tokenization, a crucial step where raw text is transformed into a structured format that the models can
interpret from. Among the variety of tokenization methods, the sentencepiece tokenizer stands out as a versatile tool
that efficiently handles diverse languages without relying on predefined word boundaries.</p><p>Tokenization not only facilitates the understanding of language nuances by models but also plays a pivotal role
in compressing textual inputs. This compression is essential, as it significantly reduces the dimensionality and complexity
of the data, enabling quicker processing and more effective learning. SentencePiece, in particular employs a subword
tokenization approach this is adept at managing vocabularies in a way that balances the granularity and the breadth of
linguistic elements.</p><p>We will focus on the intricacies of tokenizers, with a focus on SentencePiece, exploring their indespensible role in the
preprocessing of data for language models. We will discuss the general process of preprocessing, normalizing and
post-processing involved in tokenization, shedding light on how these steps contribute to the robuest performance
of language models.</p><h2 id=understanding-tokenizers>Understanding Tokenizers<a href=#understanding-tokenizers class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>Tokenizers are the first point of interaction with text data in any nlp system. They transform the raw text into tokens,
which are smaller pieces that can be more easily digested by language models. These tokenizers are essentially the building
blocks of text analysis and model training. There are several types of tokenizers, each suited to different tasks and languages.
Let&rsquo;s explore the main types and provide examples for each.</p><h3 id=preprocessing>Preprocessing<a href=#preprocessing class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>preprocessing is a critical initial step in the text handling pipeline, aimed at preparing and cleaning the text data
before it undergoes tokenization and further analysis. The main goal of preprocessing is to standardize the text to
reduce variability that is&rsquo;nt relavent for the subsequent process or analyses. This step ensures that the input to the
model is as clean and uniform as possible, improving the model&rsquo;s ability to learn and make accurate predictions.
Here are some key techniques typically employed during the preprocessing phase.</p><ol><li><p>Lowercasing: Converting all characters in the text to lowercase helps in standardizing the data. This means that words like
House and house are treated the same preventing the model from treating them as different tokens unnecassarily.</p></li><li><p>Removing special Characters and punctuation: Text often contains various punctuation marks and special characters, which
may not be necassary for many NLP tasks. Removing these elements helps focus the model on the content of words rather than formatting.</p></li><li><p>Expanding Contractions: In english and many other languages, contractions such as &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t&rdquo;, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo;. and &ldquo;it&rsquo;s&rdquo; are common.
Expanding these to &ldquo;cannot&rdquo; &ldquo;do not.&rdquo; and &ldquo;it is&rdquo; helps maintain consistency in verb forms and reduces ambiguity in parsing the text.</p></li><li><p>Removing stopwords: common words such as &ldquo;and&rdquo;, &ldquo;is&rdquo;, and &ldquo;but&rdquo; can be filtered out during preprocessing. These words are usually frequent
and carry less meaningful content for many NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis or topic modelling.</p></li><li><p>Trimming spaces: Excess whitespaces, including spaces, tabs and new lines can be normalized by trimming them to a single space or removing
them entirely, which helps in maintaining consistency in text format</p></li></ol><p>The above text format are not specifically related to sentencepiece model but are some of the common techniques used for preprocessing.</p><h3 id=normalizing>Normalizing<a href=#normalizing class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>Normalization deals with the way text is represented to ensure consistency. it is particularly important when dealing with different scripts
or when the input data comes from various sources that might format text differently.</p><ol><li><p>Unicode Normalization: Converts text to a consistent unicode format, resolving issues like different character encodings for the same
characters. Used by BPE, SentencePiece</p></li><li><p>Stemming and lemmatization: reduces words to their base or root form, either through cutting off inflections (stemming) or by
using lexical knowledge of the language (lemmatization).</p></li></ol><h2 id=byte-pair-encoding-bpe>Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)<a href=#byte-pair-encoding-bpe class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>BPE is another popular subword tokenization method originally developed for data compression. BPE iteratively merges the most frequent pairs
of bytes (or characters) in a dataset to form new tokens, which effectively reduces the vocabulary size and handles the rare words more efficiently.</p><ol><li><p>Vocabulary Independence: While both methods are effective at creating subword vocabularies, SentencePiece does not rely on
pre-tokenized text, making it more flexible in handling raw text inputs. BPE typically starts with a base vocabulary of individual
characters and builds up by merging frequent pairs.</p></li><li><p>Handling of Rare Words: Both SentencePiece and BPE help mitigate the issue of rare words through the use of subword units.
However, SentencePiece&rsquo;s algorithm allows for more direct control over the tokenization granularity, which can be advantageous
in balancing the vocabulary size against model performance.</p></li><li><p>Ease of Use: SentencePiece provides an easy-to-use implementation that integrates seamlessly with major machine learning
frameworks and supports direct text inputs. BPE often requires initial text processing and vocabulary building,
which might add complexity to the pipeline.</p></li><li><p>Performance in Multilingual Settings: SentencePiece is particularly well-suited for multilingual environments
because it treats the text as a sequence of raw Unicode characters, which naturally accommodates multiple languages
without bias towards any particular language&rsquo;s syntax or morphology.</p></li></ol><h3 id=example>Example<a href=#example class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><ul><li>Initial Text</li></ul><blockquote><p>ABABCABCD</p></blockquote><ul><li>Count frequency of pairs</li></ul><blockquote><p>AB: 3
BA: 1
BC: 2
CA: 1
CD: 1</p></blockquote><ul><li>Most frequent pair</li></ul><blockquote><p>AB</p></blockquote><ul><li>Replace <code>ab</code> with a new symbol say `x'</li></ul><blockquote><p>New text: XAXCXCD</p></blockquote><ul><li>Count the frequency of pairs in new text:</li></ul><blockquote><p>XA: 1
AX: 1
XC: 2
CX: 1
CD: 1</p></blockquote><ul><li>Most frequent pair:</li></ul><blockquote><p>XC</p></blockquote><ul><li>Repeat the same process until the desired number of tokens is achieved</li></ul><h2 id=sentencepiece-tokenizer-1>SentencePiece Tokenizer<a href=#sentencepiece-tokenizer-1 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>The SentencePiece tokenizer is a robust and flexible tool designed to efficiently manage the tokenization of
text without the need for pre-defined word boundaries. This makes it particularly suitable for languages where whitespace
is not a reliable delimiter. Unlike traditional tokenization methods that rely on whitespace and pre-defined vocabularies,
SentencePiece treats the input text as a raw stream of Unicode characters and learns a vocabulary of subword units directly from this text.</p><ol><li><p>Language Agnosticism: SentencePiece is designed to be independent of the language being processed. It works
effectively across various languages, including those that do not use spaces to separate words.</p></li><li><p>Subword Tokenization: It utilizes subword units, which can effectively capture common prefixes, suffixes, and
roots, reducing the out-of-vocabulary issue and preserving meaningful linguistic units.</p></li><li><p>End-to-End Tokenization: SentencePiece handles both the tokenization and detokenization processes, ensuring that
the original text can be perfectly reconstructed from the tokens.</p></li></ol><h3 id=example-1>Example<a href=#example-1 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><ul><li>Initial text</li></ul><blockquote><p>this is a simple example</p></blockquote><ul><li>segment the text into characters</li></ul><blockquote><p>t h i s _ i s _ a _ s i m p l e _ e x a m p l e</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>count the frequency of each character and pair of characters, then merge the most frequent pairs iteratively</p></li><li><p>assume the vocabulary learned contains</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>{&rsquo;th&rsquo;, &lsquo;is&rsquo;, &lsquo;_&rsquo;, &lsquo;a&rsquo;, &lsquo;si&rsquo;, &lsquo;mple&rsquo;, &rsquo;ex&rsquo;, &lsquo;amp&rsquo;, &rsquo;le&rsquo;}</p></blockquote><ul><li>Tokenize the text using learned vocabulary</li></ul><blockquote><p>Tokenized text: [th, is, _, is, _, a, _, si, mple, _, ex, amp, le]</p></blockquote></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><a href=/posts/online-softmax/ class="button inline prev">Online Softmax
