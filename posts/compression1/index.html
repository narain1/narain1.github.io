signals are continuous streams of varying frequencies and amplitudes. These signals can include everything from human speech
and music to ambient noises and complex soundscapes. The richness and variety in audio data make it challenging to identify
and eliminate redundancy without losing essential information.</p><h2 id=human-perception-of-sound>Human perception of sound<a href=#human-perception-of-sound class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>Human ears are sensitive to a wide range of frequencies, from about 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Our perception of sound is also
influenced by various factors, such as pitch, volume, and timbre. Any compression algorithm must take these perceptual
aspects into account to ensure that the compressed audio still sounds natural to human listeners. This requirement adds
an extra layer of complexity to the compression process.</p><h2 id=ineffictive-ways-we-visualize-waveforms>Ineffictive ways we visualize waveforms<a href=#ineffictive-ways-we-visualize-waveforms class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>Due to The huge amount of data contained in waveforms we try to interpret audio using different techniques like waveforms
spectograms these help us get heatmaps of frequency and amplitude distributions over a period of time.</p><h2 id=types-of-audio-compression>Types of audio compression<a href=#types-of-audio-compression class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><h3 id=lossless-compression>Lossless Compression:<a href=#lossless-compression class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>Techniques like FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) preserve the exact original audio data, making it possible to reconstruct
the original audio perfectly. However, the compression ratios achieved are relatively modest, typically reducing file sizes by about 50% at best.</p><h3 id=lossy-compression>Lossy Compression:<a href=#lossy-compression class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>Formats like MP3 and AAC use psychoacoustic models to remove sounds that are less perceivable to human ears. While
these methods achieve higher compression ratios, they do so at the cost of some loss in audio quality. The
challenge lies in balancing compression efficiency with audio fidelity.</p><h3 id=applications-in-audio-compression>Applications in Audio Compression<a href=#applications-in-audio-compression class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><h4 id=mp3-encoding>MP3 Encoding:<a href=#mp3-encoding class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><p>MP3 compression uses the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT), a variation of the Fourier Transform, to convert
audio signals into the frequency domain. It then applies psychoacoustic models to remove inaudible frequencies and quantizes the remaining
data to achieve compression.</p><h4 id=spectral-analysis>Spectral Analysis:<a href=#spectral-analysis class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><p>Fourier Transform is also used in various spectral analysis techniques, which help in identifying and compressing the most important
components of the audio signal while discarding redundant or less important parts.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/posts/sentencepiece-tokenizer/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
